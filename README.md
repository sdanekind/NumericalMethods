# NumericalMethods README

The Numerical Methods repository contains MATLAB functions for LU decomposition, false position, and Simpson’s 1/3 Rule. These functions are used for approximations in numerical methods. 

## Intended use
I intend for these functions to be used in introductory numerical methods classes. These functions can be used by students to help learn different approximation methods and matrix math. Calling the functions, and inputting the correct data, will give an output for each method. 

### Example Usage
1. Open MATLAB
2. Open the desired function file in MATLAB
3. Create a new script from which to call the function.
4. Declare all inputs variables needed for the function. 
5. Call the function
6. Run the script.
7. The function will return the desired outputs, based on the inputs given.
